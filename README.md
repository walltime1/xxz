My learn-by-doing attempt to get into Zig by creating a hexdump utility.
STD library only.
Many thanks to ziglings project.

Milestones:
  - Implement basic functions []
    - Basic hexdump formatter [x]
    - Read command line params [x]
    - Handle errors when suppiled params are missing/broken []
  - Going deeper []
    - Learn zig build system []
    - Coloured output []
  - Final steps []
    - Support for both -p val amd -p=val command line param formats [] 
    - Code revision, maybe I will know how to redo already implemented stuff in a better way by that moment []
      - Add comptime where it is possible []
